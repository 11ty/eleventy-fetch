# eleventy-cache-assets

_Requires Node 10+_

Fetch network resources and cache them so you don’t bombard your API (or other resources). Do this at configurable intervals—not with every build! Once per minute, or once per hour, once per day, or however often you like!

With the added benefit that if one successful request completes, you can now work offline!

This plugin can save any kind of asset—JSON, HTML, images, videos, etc.

- We use the [ava JavaScript test runner](https://github.com/avajs/ava) ([Assertions documentation](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/03-assertions.md))

<!--
## Roadmap

* Add support for tiered asset requests, e.g. CSS requests background-images and web fonts, for example.

## Open Questions

* `flat-cache` save method seems to be synchronous, is there a better async one?
* Our cache stores raw buffers internally, which are pretty bloated compared to the original. Surely there is a more efficient way to do this. Maybe store the files in their original format.
